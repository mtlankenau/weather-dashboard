## Background
For one of our coding bootcamp's challenge assignments, we were tasked with using our newly acquired skills and knowledge of API fetch requests and associated JSON object manipulation, in tandem with html, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a Weather Dashboard.

## Functionality
* When the user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
* When the user views current weather conditions for that city, they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
* When the user views the UV index, they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
* When the user views future weather conditions for that city, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
* When the user clicks on a city in the search history, then they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
